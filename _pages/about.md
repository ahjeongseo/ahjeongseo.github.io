Hi, I'm a researcher at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/">Samsung research</a>, Korea.
My primary research goal is to <b>develop robustly reasoning AI like humans</b> through structured and disentangled inference. 
Especially, I'm interested in the explicit and robust reasoning process via traversing over concept graphs constructed with neuro-symbolic approaches.

<br>
In Samsung Research, I've researched how to complement the reasoning limitations of large-scale models as well as improved a content search engine to consider both lexical and semantic clues in queries.
Before working for Samsung, I got my Master's degree from Seoul National University, 
advised by professor <a href="https://bi.snu.ac.kr/~btzhang/">Byoung-Tak Zhang</a>. 
While Master's degree, I researched how to robustly and explicitly reason via structuring information in a VideoQA task based on interdisciplinary knowledge.
